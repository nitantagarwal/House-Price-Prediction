# House-Price-Prediction

# Description: 
The aim of the project is to predict price. OLS results in overfitting where number of observations is not much greater than the number of variables, thus for such senarios other methods can be used. Here, I have demonstrated other alternatives to linear modeling. Methods include subset selection and dimensionality reduction.
